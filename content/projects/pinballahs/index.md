##### Final Prototype  

This prototype is a pinball game where the users play as the paddles. This prototype is a collaborative game where the aim is to get the highest score. The difference between our pinball and normal pinball is that to use the paddles you have to lift a giant version of them yourself. This creates a novel interaction that immerses the players further into the game.
